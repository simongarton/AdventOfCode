# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming competition, with initially simple puzzles starting
on 1 Dec, and getting progressively harder - I rarely finish the last few days.

## 2022

### Day 9: Rope Bridge

Awesome. And sneaky. Given two points (head and tail of a rope), set up a system where if the head moves, the tail
has to follow it within certain constraints. Ok, not bad. Then have ten knots on the rope, not just the 2 of head and
tail.
Refactor. Still works. Phew.

### Day 8: Treetop Tree House

Nice. Given a grid of tree heights, work out first how many trees are visible from any edge (a tree must be taller than
all the trees between it and the edge) and then how big an area you can see around it.

### Day 7: No Space Left On Device

Awesome. Given some terminal output, where the user has moved around directories and listed their contents, recreate the
disk structure and calculate the size of each directory. Tree searching and recursion.

### Day 6: Tuning Trouble

Given a long string of random characters, find the first sequence of length 4 (part 1) and 14 (part 2) where all the
characters are different.

### Day 5: Supply Stacks

The first fun one this year; build up a series of stacks of crates, and then move crates from one stack to another
following a script provided. Part 1 moved one crate at a time, part 2 moved 3 at a time (preserving the order, so not
the same as moving 1, three times.)

### Day 4: Camp Cleanup

Given a list of ranges (pairs of numbers), figure out which overlap.

### Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization

Look through strings of random characters, finding characters that appear in both halves of the string.

### Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors

Simulate a game of Rock Paper Scissors, and then read a script to play the game in a certain way.

### Day 1: Calorie Counting

Look through a list of numbers broken up into groups, build up totals per group, and pick (part 1) the biggest group (
part 2) the top 3 groups.

Analyse a range of vectors to build lines, and then work out where the lines intersect.

### Day 4: Giant Squid

Simulate bingo games, given a stream of numbers work out when certain boards will win

### Day 3: Binary Diagnostic

Read some binary numbers and manipulate them

### Day 1: Sonar Sweep

Find number of increases in a list; and then staggered over 3.
