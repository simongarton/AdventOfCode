# Advent of Code 2021

## 2021

### Day 25: Sea Cucumber

A map with the sea-floor covered in sea cucumbers; at each tick, they either move right or down, scrolling around the
map, but won't move onto another ... how many ticks until they get gridlocked ?

### Day 21: Dirac Dice

Yes, a big numbers one. Part 1 is a simple little game about two players rolling dice and moving around a circular
track. Part 2 gets cool, and each time you throw the dice, the universe splits into 3, 3 different rolls, and 3
different states of the game ... 3, 9, 27, 81 ... final answer 433315766324816.

### Day 20: Trench Map

Two bitmaps, one an algorithm to 'enhance the image' found on the other. Looks straight forward enough, can't remember
if there was a catch.

### Day 18: Snailfish

Long strings of multiple-nested brackets with numbers, expand and add items with in it. Complicated.

### Day 17: Trick Shot

In 2 dimensions simulate firing shells that arc up and are then pulled down by gravity, see if they hit a target area.
From memory this was disappointingly easy, but I did write a lot of similar stuff for fun years ago.

### Day 16: Packet Decoder

String manipulation / decryption. Straight forward and fun.

### Day 15: Chiton

Two dimensional topographic map, route find through it to have the lowest total height. A*, though my comments suggest
I was less than confident about it's implementation.

### Day 14: Extended Polymerization

String manipulation : parse a string to decode rules which in turn tells you how to update the string.

### Day 13: Transparent Origami

This was fun. A big 2d bitmap with some points marked with symbols; fold it repeatedly so the symbols start overlapping,
and when you're done you can visually see a sequence of letters.

### Day 12: Passage Pathing

Fun; build a graph and then count the number of unique ways you can travel through it from one end to another.

### Day 11: Dumbo Octopus

Fun; a 2d map of octopi, when one flashes, it encourages the other to flash; eventually all are flashing together.
Solved with a cellular automaton.

### Day 10: Syntax Scoring

Parsing lots of brackets to figure out if it's valid.

### Day 9: Smoke Basin

A map of heights - cross reference https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8. Wrote what I think is a flood-fill to solve part
2, and it worked first time ! Though I have recreated the code in 2022, can't find the class I used in 2021.

### Day 8: Seven Segment Search

Fun - based around 7 segment displays with mixed up wiring, analyse input and output to figure out the wiring. Had to
use some frequency analysis as part of the solution.

### Day 7: The Treachery of Whales

Cute : align a group of crabs in a vertical line by minimizing their horizontal moves, using two algorithms.

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7

### Day 6: Lanternfish

A population of fish that are breeding at various intervals. Not unlike Wa-Tor.

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6

### Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture

Analyse a range of vectors to build lines, and then work out where the lines intersect.

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5

### Day 4: Giant Squid

Simulate bingo games, given a stream of numbers work out when certain boards will win

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4

### Day 3: Binary Diagnostic

Read some binary numbers and manipulate them

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3

### Day 2: Dive!

Follow a list of instructions to move forward / down / at an angle.

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2

### Day 1: Sonar Sweep

Find number of increases in a list; and then staggered over 3.
