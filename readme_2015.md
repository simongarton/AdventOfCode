### Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard

Toggling a 1000x1000 grid of ints to represent lights switching on and off. There must be a more elegant
way of doing it - I just brute forced it.

### Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

It's so much fun to come crashing down when you don't think through the question. Part 1 was easy and I got to extend
my regex methods. For part 2 my regex-fu is not worthy, so I wrote some simple code which didn't give the right
answer ... and tweaked it ... and tweaked it ... and eventually realised that `aaaa` is a nightmare.

### Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

MD5 hashes. Brute forced. Puzzled - not really a challenge ?

### Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum

Track moves around a grid and count how many times you visit a given square. Then have two things moving.

### Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

But there was. Not very difficult though. Calculating surface area and perimeters of rectangular prisms.

### Day 1: Not Quite Lisp

The very first AoC puzzle. Simple string manipulation, the first one I did with regex, the second I had to write a tiny
loop.
