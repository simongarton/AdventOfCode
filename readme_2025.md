### Day 3 : Lobby

Oh, this was a good one. First part didn't look too hard, second part looks baffling. I know I could solve it with
a tree and Djikstra or a BFS ... but I didn't want to remember how to. So I went and had dinner, came back and stared
at it ... and realized it was actually pretty simple, just divide and conquer. Memoisation sort of.

### Day 2 : Gift Shop

Part 1 straight forward, part 2 ... trickier, there was a little gotcha in the logic if you weren't carefully thinking
about what the question meant.

### Day 1 : Secret Entrance

Clock arithmetic. Did it quickly with a simple algorithm. There must be a better way.
